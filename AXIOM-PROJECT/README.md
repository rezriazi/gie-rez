Welcome to Github Issue Explorer!

Using the application is simple. Search any Github Repo URL using the format https://github.com/"owner"/"repo" in the search bar.

The results will show issues within the repository. You can filter which issues to view by clicking on the filter drop down menu at the top. Issue filters include all, open, and closed, as well as the option to view pull requests.
